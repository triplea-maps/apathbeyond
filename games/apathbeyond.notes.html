					<br><b>Generic How-To-Play:</b>
					<br>The game is made up of rounds, during a round each player gets to do a number of steps/phases.
					<br>The phases are, in order: Research Technology, Repair Factories and Purchase Units, Combat Movement, Resolve Battles, Non-Combat Movement, Place Units.
					<br>At the beginning of your turn, you purchase units. At the end of the turn, you get to place those units in territories you own that have a factory.
					<br>During Combat Movment, you move any units to attack enemy units and territories. During Non-Combat Movement, you may move any units that have movement left (attacking an enemy remove any movement of land and sea units, but not air units).
					<br>Battles happen by use of dice. A unit has a certain attack power, and you roll a dice for each unit. If your dice is equal or less than the attack power of the unit, you have scored a hit.
						So for example, a tank attacks on 3. For it, you will roll a single die, and if you score 1-3 on the die you have hit the enemy, while if you score 4-6 you have missed the enemy. An infantry defends on 2, so a roll of 1-2 is a hit, while 3-6 are misses.
					<br>After the attacker has rolled dice for each of his units, the defender tallies the total number of 'hits' and then selects which of his defending units will die later. After this, the defender rolls for his units and the attacker selects which of his units will die.
						When both have finished rolling, the units selected to die are removed from the game. If there are no more attackers left, then the defender has won, and if there are no more defenders left, then the attacker has won and he moves his remaining attacking units into that territory.
						If both players have units left still, the attack may choose to play another round of battle, or retreat all his remaining forces to a territory where at least one of his forces came from.
